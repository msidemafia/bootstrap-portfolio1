        <p>
            I was born in New Jersey and later on found myself at Rutgers. It was clear to me that since I had a knack
            for playing musical instruments, that I should get my degreee in music. After graduating and getting a job 
            at an Amazon warehouse, it was clear to me that this was not the right path for me. I didn't want a career in 
            music, but I couldn't do much without going back to school
        </p>
        <p>
            Coding has always intrigued me, but I never really thought of learning how to do it. I know many people who do 
            it for a living or who are in school learning how to do it. Eventually I got to a point where I had to try something 
            new and I learned about the Rutgers Coding Boot Camp.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am in the process of learning some of the basics and I have to say that I am glad I made this decision.
            Learning how to code is frustrating at times, but I love it.
